**Voice Notes**

**What is This?**
<br />
Voice Notes is a straightforward app built with Vanilla JavaScript, utilizing the Web Speech API to convert text into speech. Through the SpeechSynthesisUtterance interface, the app can read aloud notes with customizable language, pitch, and volume settings. This makes it easy to listen back to any notes youâ€™ve taken, offering a hands-free experience for reviewing your essential points.

Key Features:
->Text-to-Speech Conversion: Enter text and hear it spoken aloud.
->Customizable Settings: Adjust language, pitch, and volume for an optimal listening experience.
->Easy-to-Use Interface: Intuitive layout with simple controls, no external dependencies.

This project demonstrates how the SpeechSynthesisUtterance interface of the Web Speech API can be used to enhance accessibility and improve productivity by transforming typed notes into spoken words.
